    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 thick-cut bacon slices</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1 inch thickness</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup drained julienne-cut sundried tomatoes in oil with herbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped shallot</li>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lower-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 (20 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pre-grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>torn fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Gather all ingredients. Fill a large saucepan with salted water and bring to a boil over high heat.
        <br>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped bacon; cook, stirring occasionally, <br>
        until rendered and crispy, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined 
        <br> plate to drain, reserving about 3 tablespoons drippings in skillet.
    </p>
    <p>While bacon cooks, sprinkle chicken evenly with pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Add chicken to skillet with drippings; <br> 
    cook over medium-high, until chicken is browned and cooked through (a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken <br> 
    registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C)), 5 to 6 minutes per side, reducing heat if bottom of pan gets too dark. Transfer chicken <br> 
    to a plate; set aside until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Chop chicken into bite-size pieces.</p>

    <p>Reduce heat to medium, and add sundried tomatoes and shallot. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. <br>
    Add garlic, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, <br> 
    about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until deepened in color, about 1 minute.</p>

    <p>Pour in chicken broth; cook, stirring and scraping constantly to deglaze the skillet, about 1 minute. <br>
    Stir in cream and bring to a simmer over medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. <br> 
    Add tortellini to boiling water, and boil until tortellini are tender and float to the surface, 3 to 5 minutes. <br> 
    Reserve 1 cup cooking water. Drain. </p>

    <p>Stir Parmesan cheese, reserved cooked bacon, reserved chopped chicken, and tortellini into skillet with cream mixture. <br> 
    Cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until evenly coated in sauce. Add reserved cooking water, 1/4 cup at a time, <br> 
    if necessary to maintain a creamy consistency. Divide mixture among 6 bowls; garnish with additional Parmesan cheese and <br> 
    a generous scattering of fresh basil.</p>
